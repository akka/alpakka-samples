## Example code

### Description
- Configure Kafka consumer (1)
- Data class mapped to Elasticsearch (2)
- @scala[Spray JSON]@java[Jackson] conversion for the data class (3)
- Elasticsearch client setup (4)
- Kafka consumer with committing support (5)
- Use `FlowWithContext` to focus on `ConsumerRecord` (6)
- Parse message from Kafka to `Movie` and create Elasticsearch write message (7)
- Use `createWithContext` to use an Elasticsearch flow with context-support (so it passes through the Kafka committ offset) (8)
- React on write errors (9)
- Make the context visible again and just keep the committable offset (10)
- Let the `Committer.sink` aggregate commits to batches and commit to Kafka (11)
- Combine consumer control and stream completion into `DrainingControl` (12)
